# RN_TS_ESlint_Prettier

A simple implementation to understand the effective usable area for React Native using SaveViewArea concept of iOS.
Thanks to @janicduplessis for react-native-safe-area-context package which hides lots of boiler plate code to achieve the same in Android as well.

Additionally a little tweak in Android app/MainActivity.java to make the StatusBar and NavigationBar translucent.

#### Android:

![Alt text](androidrotation.mov?raw=true 'Android Save Area')

#### iOS

![Alt text](iosrotation.mov?raw=true 'iOS Save Area')
